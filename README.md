Hello everyone!
Writing this blog to share my experience in the Oasis Data Analytics internship.

I am Gauri vase , currently pursuing my B.Tech degree at D Y Patil International University. Eager to enhance my skills, I actively sought internships and was recommended Oasis Infobyte by my peers. Concentrating on data analytics, I dedicated myself to the internship. Receiving the offer letter on May 20, 2024, filled me with excitement and anticipation for the learning journey ahead.
